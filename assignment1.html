    <h4><b>Director:</b> Rose Marshack</h4>
    <h4><b>Degrees Offered:</b> B.A., B.S.</h4>

    <h2><b>Major in Creative Technologies</b></h2>

    <p>The interdisciplinary Creative Technologies major emphasizes design and practice in the integration of digital technologies and the fine arts. In addition to foundational study across the fine arts, the<br> major provides training and experiences across a range of creative/technical fields including video, sound, electronic music, music production, gaming, motion graphics, interactivity, AR/VR,<br> UI/UX, mobile, web, and computer programming concepts.</p>

<h3><b>Retention Requirements</b></h3>
<ul>
<p><li><b>Sequence in Audio and Music Production and Interdisciplinary Technologies</b>- Students will be allowed to continue in this sequence <em>if they meet and continue to maintain an overall<br> cumulative GPA of 2.00.</em></li></p>
<p><li><b>Sequence in Game Design</b> - Students will be allowed to continue in this sequence <em>if they meet and continue to maintain an overall cumulative GPA of 2.50 and a cumulative GPA of 3.0</em><br> within the major. Additionally, students in the Game Design Sequence must maintain consecutive Fallâ€“Spring enrollment in their final at the University. Any student not enrolled at the<br> university for more than one semester must reapply to the sequence. Students who leave the Sequence in Game Design may continue as a Creative Technologies major in Audio and Music<br> Production or Interdisciplinary Technologies <em>if they have an overall cumulative GPA of 2.00.</em></li></p>
</ul>
<h3><b>Standards for Progress in the Major</b></h3>
<p>Students will be allowed to continue in the Creative Technologies program if they met and continue to maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.50 and have demonstrated competency through an<br> intermediate portfolio review.</p>
